**Kaggle Forest Cover Type Prediction**  ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ¿
Welcome to the Kaggle Forest Cover Type Prediction project! This repository hosts code and resources related to predicting forest cover types based on cartographic variables.

**About the Project**
The Forest Cover Type Prediction challenge on Kaggle aims to predict the predominant forest cover type for a given geographical area based on various cartographic features. These features include elevation, slope, soil type, and wilderness area, among others. The dataset consists of both categorical and continuous variables, making it an interesting problem for predictive modeling.

**Objective**
The main objective of this project is to develop machine learning models that accurately classify forest cover types based on the provided dataset. Participants typically utilize a variety of algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, and neural networks to achieve high predictive accuracy.

**Dataset**
The dataset provided by Kaggle includes over half a million data points, with each data point representing a 30x30 meter cell of land in the Roosevelt National Forest. The dataset contains a total of 55 features, including both numerical and categorical variables.
